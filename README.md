    BY USING THIS PROGRAM, YOU SIGNIFY YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS
    OF USE.  IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, DO NOT USE THIS PROGRAM.

Overview
--------

The Email-to-CybOX program generates CybOX XML output from an RFC822 email, formatted
in plain text. The email is read from a file (or STDIN using '-') and the CybOX output
is printed to STDOUT.

Compatible with:
* [CybOX 2.0.1](http://cybox.mitre.org/language/version2.0.1/)

Installation
------------

Download and extract the included files into your directory of choice. 

OpenIOC-to-CybOX requires Python 2.X. It was developed using Python 2.7, and may work 
under Python 2.6. It is not compatible with Python 3.

### Dependencies 

* [python-cybox](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cybox) - A Python library for CybOX
* [dnspython](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/dnspython) - A DNS toolkit for Python
* [python-whois](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-whois) - Whois querying and parsing of domain registration information.

You can install the dependencies using pip:

    $ pip install cybox dnspython python-whois

**NOTE**: Installing LXML (which python-cybox depends on) on Ubuntu requrires the
python-dev, libxml2-dev, and libxslt1-dev packages to be installed. 
Follow the link for instructions on installing python-cybox and LXML on Windows.

If you are using Python 2.6, you will also need to install the 
[argparse](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/argparse) module, which became of the Python 
Standard Library in Python 2.7.
